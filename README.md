# RUBY Covid Stats Scraper
This is a capstone project for Microverse program. In this project I have to develop an scraper using Ruby.
I have developed an scraper that takes real time data from worldometers.info

You can choose or type a country to get it's infections, deaths and recoveres stats, or you can choose to get the world stats.
